This is the included plugins folder ie plugings that are in my github and accepted by this project maintainers

To add your own plugins thay should go in the configfolder/plugins folder this will over ride any plugins in this folder.

IE if you don't like my plugin or are working on bug fixes or like soem of what it does and want to suggest a change copy it to the configFolder/plugins change it up and it will override whats included in this project.
