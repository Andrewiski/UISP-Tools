There's no telephone line and no dialing; you're always connected. A small radio transceiver is mounted on your home or office building that establishes the connection with one of our broadcast locations. Because the radios require clear line of site between the transmitting and receiving antennas, the radio is typically mounted on the roof, chimney or on an existing television antenna mast.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">A network cable is run from the radio transceiver to a small power injector in your home or office. You simply plug the network connector on the power injector into your computer's network interface card and you're on the air! You can even connect your entire home or office network to the Internet using the same radio transceiver.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">We realize that many homeowners associations are concerned about the appearance of external antennas. Digital Example has selected a radio transceiver that is so small it's hardly noticeable. In addition, in the interest of ensuring that broadband Internet access is made available to the masses, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has passed a ruling that allows wireless Internet access antennas to be installed even in areas where homeowners association's rules prevent other types of antennas. A copy of the FCC document detailing this ruling is available at<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/otard.html\" target=\"\">http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/otard.html</a></span></p><hr style=\"height: 1px;color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\"/><p style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">1. Activation and installation fees are non-refundable.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">2. Professional installation includes mounting the subscriber module and surge suppressor (when necessary) and running and securing the network cable down the outside of the building and in through a single wall penetration. Alternative wiring solutions, custom wall jacks, etc. are also available for an additional charge.</p>",
